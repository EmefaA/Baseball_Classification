    "Baseball is described more accurately with the Markov chain model due to conditional probability distribution. The future states of the baseball depend upon the present state and not the sequence of events that preceded it. Based on modeling assumptions, the Markov chain can predict which teams score in the top third without classification."

In addition, the initial accuracy and F1 score of the Random Forest model was 0.84 and 0.77 but was fine tuned with a Randomized Search Cross-Validation model and improved the accuracy and F1 score to 0.99 and 0.98."
